I used on of shakespare famous sonnents for my poem in the txt file.

I followed the instruction in the course website and use 4 different functions to print out the poem.
I first made sure the poem was able to be read.
Then I printed it backwards with number, later printed it randomly with repeats, finally i printed it in increments of two. 
Where all the odd numbers correspoinding to the poem werent printed.
